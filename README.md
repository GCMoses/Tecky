No production in use. This is a test app for promotion purpose
Start-up business site. Perfect for Organisation/Entrepeneur to store their products,  owner(seller) will be able to modify their own products. 
Everything will be layered out in the database and all you have to do is fill those tables with products. 
If a customer want products they must submit a Inquiry that will be sent to Admin populated with the product id, name, email & phone number. 
Perfect for a start-up business, because you can manage it all by yourself and as business grow you can add more admin roles to employees.
Customers won't be able to see the content management dropdown due to the Authorization and will only be able to send an inquiry to the main Email Admin.
I left my email here as a reference in the Web Constants(WC.cs) so if you do decide to use my project please send me an inquiry. 
Use mailjet for messaging API v1.22 because higher versions of the  mailjetAPI nuGet package give weird uresolvable errors

Enjoy a fully populated application that even a kid can manage.


With time Godwilling if the business grow you will want to upgrade to upgrade to my larger scale version of this application.
Larger scale version will include orders, transactions using credit card, shipping info and data table where admin can view everything inquiry, place order and send you a purchase receipt
larger scale app site 
I can't post the repository, because it hold sensetive info.
